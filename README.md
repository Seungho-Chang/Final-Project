# Final-Project
BAIS:3300 Final Project

Sprint 1

1. Decide what kind of site you want to build and set up the infrastructure.
- Are you building a dynamic site (like Flask & Python) or are you building a static site (HTML)?
- Are you building from scratch, building with a framework like Bootstrap or Tailwinds, or using a template?
- Find a template you want to use or decide on a framework to use.
- If you are using a template, get it downloaded and extracted.

2. Create a GitHub repository and prepare your template for an initial commit.
- Create a repository for your portfolio on GitHub and clone it to your local computer.
- Add a .gitignore file to exclude sensitive or unnecessary files from GitHub.
- Put your HTML template page(s) and supporting files in the repository.
- Edit your files to create a standard page template. Remove unnecessary code. 
- Validate your template against HTML5 and CSS3. Validate to WCAG 2.1, Level AA. Edit as necessary to achieve validation.
- When you have a template complete that validates, make an initial commit.

3. Build and Azure app for your project and connect your custom domain.
- Create an Azure app and configure it to pull from your portfolio repository.
- Configure your new Azure app to use your custom domain.
- Configure SSL certificate for your domain (if necessary).

4. Connect Google Analytics to your template so we can measure user traffic.
- Create a new Google Account (gmail). I would keep this separate from your regular email account.
- Visit analytics.google.com and create a new Google Analytics account.
- Get the tracking code and add it to the bottom of each page or to your template page. 
- Verify it is correctly connected and you can see users connecting by visiting your site.

5. Add some content to your home page so it can be identified as you.
- Make a copy of your template.
- Add content to the home page so users can correctly identify it when they visit.
- Verify your page passes HTML5, CSS, and WCAG2.1, level AA after your edits.
- Commit so your new changes are pushed to production.
